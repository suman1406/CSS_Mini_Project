# CSS_Mini_Project

This GitHub repository contains the code for a CSS mini project that implements a responsive sidebar menu with navigation links and social media icons. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and some external libraries for styling and iconography.

The main features of the project include:

Responsive Sidebar Menu: The sidebar menu is designed to be responsive and can be toggled open and closed using a toggle button. It provides easy navigation with a list of links to different sections of the website.

Navigation Icons: The menu includes icons alongside the navigation links, making it visually appealing and intuitive for users to identify the purpose of each link.

Social Media Integration: The sidebar also includes icons for popular social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. These icons can be used to link to the respective social media profiles or pages.

Styling and Fonts: The project utilizes the Roboto font from Google Fonts for a clean and modern look. It also includes Font Awesome icons for enhanced visual elements. The CSS file (style.css) contains the necessary styles and customizations to achieve the desired layout and design.

This repository serves as a demonstration and starting point for developers interested in implementing a responsive sidebar menu with CSS. It can be used as a reference or as a foundation for further customization and integration into larger web projects.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own needs. Contributions and improvements to the project are also welcome.
